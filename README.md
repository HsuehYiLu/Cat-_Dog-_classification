# Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```


Navigate to the project directory:
bash
```bash
cd cats-vs-dogs-classification
```

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the appropriate directories:

Place the training images in data/train
Place the test images in data/test
Run the main script to train the model and evaluate its performance:

```bash
python main.py
```
